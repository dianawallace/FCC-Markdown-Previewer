FreeCodeCamp: Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Markdown Previewer

This is the second of the Front End Libraries Projects in Free Code Camp. The objective was to build a personal portfolio website that meets Free Code Camp's user stories requirements.

I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React.

You can find the list of requirements below as well as further information on this project here. You can view my completed project on github [here](https://dianawallace.github.io/FCC-Markdown-Previewer/) and codepen [here](https://codepen.io/dianawallacedeveloper/pen/exqpKm).


User Story #1: I can see a textareaelement with a corresponding id="editor".

User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

User Story #3: When I enter text into the #editorelement, the #previewelement is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editorelement, the text is rendered as HTML in the #previewelement as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editorfield should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editorfield should be rendered as HTML in the #previewelement.

Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).

Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br(line break) elements.
